## Data Analytics Projects

### [LetsMeet SQL Project](https://github.com/IstvanTringel/LetsMeet-SQL)

My SQL project at Texas A&M University's Reynolds and Reynolds Sales Leadership Institute- Data Analytics and Agile Leadership Professional Certificate.

In this project, I was acting as a junior data analyst hired to support the growth of a new company. I assessed the existing infrastructure, applied appropriate changes to its database, and presented insights to stakeholders overseeing my work. I wrote multiple queries (20+) ranging in complexity to assess my MySQL skills.

This Project is broken down into four parts: 

Part 1: SQL scripts containing the DDL and DML queries

Part 2: Written reports that summarize key information and insights for my manager 

Part 3: An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) of my updated database

Part 4: A final SQL technical assessment

My job in completing these project parts was supporting the growth of LetsMeet. LetsMeet is a fictional website that provides a platform for users to create and search for real-world events that match their interests and location.

### [Listings123 Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/IstvanTringel/Listings123-Exploratory-Data-Analysis)

My initial project at Texas A&M University's Reynolds and Reynolds Sales Leadership Institute- Data Analytics and Agile Leadership Professional Certificate. 

In this project, I was brought on board as a business analyst at Listings123, a burgeoning home-sharing service connecting hosts and guests. The company aimed to expand to new cities through a strategic marketing campaign and needed funding from investors. I utilized Exploratory Data Analysis to identify successful host traits and gather recommendations for convincing investors of the company's potential.

## Tableau-Projects

### [Building Custom Tables with NYC Real Estate Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project1ABuildingCustomTableswithNYCRealEstateData/Sheet3?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

In this project, I was exploring a New York City real estate dataset. Within the dataset, I found records of all buildings and building units sold within New York City over a 12-month period. It was my job to take the data, process it, search for patterns, and create insightful tables to summarize the data.

### [Creating Data Visualizations with NYC Real Estate Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project1BCreateDataVisualizationswithNYCRealEstateData_17162320364870/Sheet5?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This project is an extension of Project 1A. Previously, I created tables for an NYC real estate investment company. In this project, I was still working for the same real estate investment company but am now focused on creating visualizations to help me determine which neighborhood might be good to invest in. I used skills in preprocessing data, formatting, assigning data types, and adhering to best practices to create visualizations that analyze the New York City real estate dataset.

### [Building a Tableau Story with World Bank Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project2BuildaTableauStorywithWorldBankData_17164887687790/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

In this project, I was building worksheets, dashboards, and story points â€” to create an analytical story. This project aimed to allow me to take an unfamiliar dataset, explore and analyze the data to discover insights, and then create a Tableau story to highlight my findings. I was exploring a dataset that is almost like a rite of passage for anyone involved in analytics: The World Development Indicators dataset, created and maintained by the World Bank.

Within the data source, I found data related to business, technology, travel, and the population in countries around the world from 2013 through 2019. It was my job to explore these indicators and relay my findings to stakeholders. Specifically, I have just been hired as a data analyst to help start a company that will focus on booking railway travel.

My goal was to make a data-based recommendation as to which country they should select to launch the startup.

### [Creating Advanced Visualizations with Stock Market Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project3CreateAdvancedVisualizationswithStockMarketData_17165827645600/Sheet1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

In this project, I created a dashboard for exploring historical trading prices for a collection of stocks. I was using two datasets, one with stock prices and another with stock symbols for companies on the S&P 500 index. The first dataset consists of daily opening and closing values, high and low values, and the volume of shares traded.

## Project Management Projects

### [Sauce and Spoon Project Management](https://github.com/IstvanTringel/Sauce-and-Spoon-Project-Management)

My first project for the Google Project Management course involved leading a project for Sauce & Spoon, a small restaurant chain looking to drive growth and expansion.

As project manager, I oversaw the implementation of tabletop menu tablets to increase efficiency and gather data for strategic decision-making.

### [PlantPals Project Management](https://github.com/IstvanTringel/PlantPals-Project-Management)

Plant Pals was my capstone project for the Google Project Management course, where I took on the role of project manager responsible for updating documentation to ensure a successful launch.

The project revolved around Office Green, a commercial landscaping company, introducing the Plant Pals service that offers small, low-maintenance plants to high-volume customers. In this role, I was tasked with managing the rollout of this new service for the company.
