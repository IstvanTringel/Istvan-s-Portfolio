## Data Analytics Projects

### [LetsMeet-SQL-Project](https://github.com/IstvanTringel/LetsMeet-SQL)

My SQL project at Texas A&M University's Reynolds and Reynolds Sales Leadership Institute- Data Analytics and Agile Leadership Professional Certificate.

In this project, I was acting as a junior data analyst hired to support the growth of a new company. I assessed the existing infrastructure, applied appropriate changes to its database, and presented insights to stakeholders that were overseeing my work. I wrote multiple queries (20+) ranging in complexity to assess my MySQL skills.

This Project is broken down into four parts: 

Part 1: SQL scripts containing the DDL and DML queries
Part 2: Written reports that summarize key information and insights for my manager 
Part 3: An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) of my updated database
Part 4: A final SQL technical assessment
My job in completing these project parts was to support the growth of LetsMeet. LetsMeet is a fictional website that provides a platform for users to create and search for real-world events that match their interests and location.
