## Data Analytics Projects

### [LetsMeet SQL Project](https://github.com/IstvanTringel/LetsMeet-SQL)

My SQL project at Texas A&M University's Reynolds and Reynolds Sales Leadership Institute- Data Analytics and Agile Leadership Professional Certificate.

In this project, I was acting as a junior data analyst hired to support the growth of a new company. I assessed the existing infrastructure, applied appropriate changes to its database, and presented insights to stakeholders overseeing my work. I wrote multiple queries (20+) ranging in complexity to assess my MySQL skills.

This Project is broken down into four parts: 

Part 1: SQL scripts containing the DDL and DML queries

Part 2: Written reports that summarize key information and insights for my manager 

Part 3: An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) of my updated database

Part 4: A final SQL technical assessment

My job in completing these project parts was supporting the growth of LetsMeet. LetsMeet is a fictional website that provides a platform for users to create and search for real-world events that match their interests and location.

### [Listings123 Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/IstvanTringel/Listings123-Exploratory-Data-Analysis)

My initial project at Texas A&M University's Reynolds and Reynolds Sales Leadership Institute- Data Analytics and Agile Leadership Professional Certificate. 

In this project, I was brought on board as a business analyst at Listings123, a burgeoning home-sharing service connecting hosts and guests. The company aimed to expand to new cities through a strategic marketing campaign and needed funding from investors. I utilized Exploratory Data Analysis to identify successful host traits and gather recommendations for convincing investors of the company's potential.


## Project Management Projects

### [Sauce and Spoon Project Management](https://github.com/IstvanTringel/Sauce-and-Spoon-Project-Management)

My first project for the Google Project Management course involved leading a project for Sauce & Spoon, a small restaurant chain looking to drive growth and expansion.

As project manager, I oversaw the implementation of tabletop menu tablets to increase efficiency and gather data for strategic decision-making.

### [PlantPals Project Management](https://github.com/IstvanTringel/PlantPals-Project-Management)

Plant Pals was my capstone project for the Google Project Management course, where I took on the role of project manager responsible for updating documentation to ensure a successful launch.

The project revolved around Office Green, a commercial landscaping company, introducing the Plant Pals service that offers small, low-maintenance plants to high-volume customers. In this role, I was tasked with managing the rollout of this new service for the company.
